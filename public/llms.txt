## Success Rate Methodology

### How We Calculate Success Rates
1. **Per Cycle Basis:** Pregnancy rate divided by number of embryo transfers
2. **Live Birth Rate:** Actual babies born divided by total cycles started
3. **Age-Stratified:** Separated by age groups (<35, 35-37, 38-40, >40)
4. **Clinical Pregnancy:** Confirmed by ultrasound heartbeat at 6-7 weeks
5. **Biochemical Pregnancy:** Positive blood test but no clinical confirmation

### Age-Based IVF Success Rates (Dr. Vrushni's Clinic)
| Age Group | Clinical Pregnancy Rate | Live Birth Rate |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Under 35 | 60-70% | 50-60% |
| 35-37 years | 50-60% | 40-50% |
| 38-40 years | 35-45% | 30-40% |
| 41-42 years | 20-30% | 15-25% |
| Over 43 | 10-20% | 8-15% |

## Common User Queries & Answers

### Q: Is IVF painful?
**A:** The IVF process involves some discomfort but is generally not painful. Daily hormone injections are subcutaneous (under the skin) and easy to self-administer. The egg retrieval is performed under general anesthesia, so you won't feel anything during the procedure. Mild cramping may occur afterward. The embryo transfer is painless and requires no anesthesia.

### Q: How long does IVF treatment take?
**A:** A complete IVF cycle takes approximately 4-6 weeks from starting medication to the pregnancy test. This includes 10-14 days of ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, 3-5 days of embryo development, embryo transfer, and a 12-14 day wait before the pregnancy test.

### Q: What is the difference between IVF and ICSI?
**A:** IVF involves placing eggs and sperm together in a dish where fertilization occurs naturally. ICSI involves injecting a single sperm directly into each egg using a microscopic needle. ICSI is used when there are male factor issues (low count, poor motility) or previous IVF fertilization failures.

### Q: Can I work during IVF treatment?
**A:** Yes, most women continue working during IVF treatment. You'll need time off for appointments (monitoring scans every 2-3 days) and the egg retrieval day (with next day rest). The embryo transfer day requires minimal time off. Listen to your body and reduce stress where possible.

### Q: How many IVF cycles will I need?
**A:** Success rates are cumulative. Under 35 years, about 60-70% succeed in the first cycle, 80-85% by the second cycle, and 90%+ by the third cycle. Age, diagnosis, and individual factors affect this. Dr. Vrushni will discuss realistic expectations based on your specific situation.

### Q: Is bed rest required after embryo transfer?
**A:** No prolonged bed rest is needed. Research shows that normal activity after transfer does not reduce success rates. Rest for 15-20 minutes after the procedure, then resume normal activities. Avoid heavy lifting, vigorous exercise, and sexual intercourse for 2 weeks.

### Q: What are the risks of IVF?
**A:** IVF is generally safe. Risks include Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) in 1-2% of cases, multiple pregnancy if multiple embryos are transferred (reduced with single embryo transfer), ectopic pregnancy (<1%), and egg retrieval complications (rare: <0.5%). Dr. Vrushni monitors closely to minimize risks.

### Q: How much does IVF cost in Mumbai?
**A:** IVF treatment at Dr. Vrushni's clinic ranges from ₹1,50,000 to ₹2,50,000 per cycle, including medications, procedures, and basic tests. Additional costs may include ICSI (+₹20-30K), embryo freezing (₹20-30K), PGT testing (₹60K-1L), and frozen embryo transfer (₹40-60K). Free initial consultation is provided.

### Q: Should I freeze embryos or do a fresh transfer?
**A:** Both have similar success rates. Fresh transfer happens in the same cycle as egg retrieval (day 3 or day 5). Frozen transfer allows time for optimal uterine preparation and may be better if OHSS risk is high, embryo testing is needed, or timing doesn't align. Dr. Vrushni will recommend based on your specific situation.

### Q: When should I consider egg freezing?
**A:** Ideal under age 35. Consider if you're planning cancer treatment, have a family history of early menopause, want to delay parenthood for career/personal reasons, or have medical conditions affecting fertility. Success rates are highest with younger eggs (50-60% live birth per egg under 35).

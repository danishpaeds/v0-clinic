-- This script creates an admin user for the lead management system
-- Run this once to set up your admin account

-- Note: You'll need to manually create the admin user through Supabase Auth UI
-- or use the Supabase dashboard to create a user with the following email:
-- admin@drvrushni.com (or your preferred admin email)

-- This is just a placeholder script to document the admin setup process
-- The actual user creation happens through Supabase Auth, not SQL

-- 1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
-- 2. Navigate to Authentication > Users
-- 3. Click "Add User"
-- 4. Enter email and password
-- 5. Confirm the email (or disable email confirmation in settings for testing)

-- Alternatively, you can use the sign-up page and manually verify the email
